# qbittorrent-cli

A cli to manage qBittorrent.

## Install

Download binary and put somewhere in $PATH.

Extract binary

    tar -xzvf qbt.tar.gz

Move to somewhere in `$PATH`. Need sudo if not already root. Or put it in your user `$HOME/bin` or similar.

    sudo mv qbt /usr/bin/

Verify that it runs

    qbt

This should print out basic usage.

## Configuration

Create a new configuration file `.qbt.toml` in `$HOME/.config/qbt/`.

    mkdir -p ~/.config/qbt && touch ~/.config/qbt/.qbt.toml

A bare minimum config.

```toml
[qbittorrent]
host     = "127.0.0.1" # qbittorrent webui-api hostname/ip
port     = 6776        # qbittorrent webui-api port
login    = "user"      # qbittorrent webui-api user
password = "password"  # qbittorrent webui-api password

[rules]
enabled              = true   # enable or disable rules
max_active_downloads = 2      # set max active downloads
```

* If running on HDDs and 1Gbit - `max_active_downloads = 2` is a good setting to not overload the disks and gives as much bandwidth as possible to the torrents.
* For SSDs and 1Gbit+ you can increase this value.

### rutorrent-autodl-irssi setup

In rutrorrent, go to autodl-irssi `Preferences`, and then the `Action` tab. Put in the following for the global action. This can be set in a specific filter as well.

```
Choose .torrent action: Run Program
Command: /usr/bin/qbt
Arguments: add "$(TorrentPathName)"
```

Add a new torrent to qBittorrent.

    qbt add my-torrent-file.torrent

### Import

Flags:
* `--from` - Import from client (only deluge supported currently)
* `--deluge-dir` - Deluge dir (~/.config/deluge)
* `--qbit-dir` - Qbittorrent dir (~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/BT_backup)

> WARNING: Make sure to stop both Deluge and qBittorrent before importing.

Import torrents from another client into qBittorrent. Example with Deluge.

    qbt import --from deluge --deluge-dir ~/.config/deluge --qbit-dir ~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/BT_backup

After the import you will have to manually delete the torrents from Deluge, but don't check the "also delete files" as currently the import DOES NOT move the actual data.
